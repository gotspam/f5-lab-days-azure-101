Module – Deploy a Standalone F5 BIG-IP Application Delivery Controller in Azure
=================================================================================

In this lab you will be deploying a standalone F5 BIG-IP in Azure to sit
in front of an instance of WordPress. The old-fashioned way (e.g. manual) will
be used in order to build out the environment and the F5. A later lab will
utilize orchestration to help automate the process. For this lab, it's important
to understand the fundamentals and what goes behind deploying an F5 in the cloud
in addition to the actual cloud components (e.g. networks, security groups, VMs).
